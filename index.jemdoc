== About me
I received the B.S. degree at University of Cagliari in pure Mathematics and the M.Sc. degree at University of Trento in Coding Theory and Cryptography. I got my Ph.D. degree in Computer Security at Univeristy of Bergen, Norway, under the supervision of professor Igor Semaev. Since February 2022, I work at the Cryptography Research Center of the Technology Innovation Institute in Abu Dhabi. 

I am always interested in hearing from colleagues, other cryptography fans, or just interesting creative folk, so feel free to contact me.

Hobbies: photography, skiing (downhill and cross-country), hiking, surfing (when I can), climbing. Also, I have been a semi-professional juggler and performed in international juggling conventions and festivals.

== Coding
- I am a member of the PERK signature submission to the NIST standardization competition and a contributer to the implementation.
- [https://github.com/AlessandroBudroni/EHT-C EHT-C] is my PoC of the public-key cryptosystem EHT on github.
- I am the creator of the [https://github.com/FBBL/rbbl rbbl] (RAM-Based BKW for LWE) library: a fast and parallelized library written in C to solve LWE instances.
- I mantain the [https://github.com/FBBL/fbbl fbbl] (File-Based BKW for LWE) library. This is the first implementation of the BKW algorithm for LWE able to solve relatively large LWE instances.
- I have been mantaining the Apache [https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto-c milagro-crypto-c] and [https://github.com/apache/incubator-milagro-crypto-js milagro-crypto-js] libraries.
