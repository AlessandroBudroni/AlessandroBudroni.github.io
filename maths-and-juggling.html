      <h2>A mathematical language for juggling</h2>
      <p>We have all seen, at least once in our life, a juggler tossing balls in the air. Why is that so impressive to our eyes?</p>
      <p>Despite having just two hands, any respectable juggler can juggle three balls at the same time. Considering, for simplicity, that one can handle one ball per hand, how is that possible?</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="math_and_juggling/3.gif" alt="Animation: 3-ball cascade" />
        <figcaption>Animation 1: the 3-ball cascade.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Let’s analyze the cascade above. Each ball is tossed from one hand to the other: the right hand throws to the left hand and vice versa. Just as a ball is about to be caught, the juggler launches another ball to free the hand for the catch. Juggling three or more balls is possible by iterating this principle.</p>

      <figure>
        <img src="math_and_juggling/531.gif" alt="Animation: alternative 3-ball pattern at different heights" />
        <figcaption>Animation 2: still 3 balls, but at different heights (a different pattern).</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>As you can imagine, there is a wide variety of patterns and, if we were to assign a distinct name to each one, it would be a prohibitive memory exercise.</p>
      <p>For this reason, Paul Klimek and Don Hatch independently invented a notation system in the early 1980s to describe and name juggling tricks&mdash;what we now call <em>siteswap</em>.
      When Klimek first introduced it, he referred to the notation as <em>quantum juggling</em>.
      The system was later extended by jugglers such as Bruce Tiemann, Jack Boyce, and Ben Beever (see <a href="#" data-external="https://groups.google.com/g/rec.juggling/c/SHYhB9OYOuM/m/DzmqEZkMqfQJ">this discussion</a>).</p>


      <p>Siteswap can describe (and name) juggling patterns with any number of balls and jugglers, covering both synchronous and asynchronous throws. Below is the same pattern executed asynchronously and synchronously.</p>

      <div class="grid">
        <figure>
          <img src="math_and_juggling/4.gif" alt="Asynchronous version of a pattern" />
          <figcaption>Asynchronous</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="math_and_juggling/44.gif" alt="Synchronous version of a pattern" />
          <figcaption>Synchronous</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

      <p>For simplicity, we will focus on the so‑called <em>vanilla</em> siteswap: one juggler, two hands, alternating throws.</p>

      <h2>A limitation of the siteswap notation</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <figure>
          <img src="math_and_juggling/3.gif" alt="Cascade again" />
          <figcaption>Cascade</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="math_and_juggling/3Mills.gif" alt="Mill's Mess" />
          <figcaption>Mill’s Mess</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>The right‑hand pattern above (Mill’s Mess) is still a cascade, but with crossed and alternating hand positions. Even though the two animations look very different, they have the <em>same</em> siteswap. Siteswap encodes the timing, direction, and relative height of throws&mdash;not the body mechanics of <em>how</em> you execute the pattern.</p>

      <h2>A number for each toss</h2>
      <p>The idea is simple: assign a non‑negative integer to each throw, equal to the number of <em>beats</em> until the same ball is caught and thrown again. Odd numbers (1,3,5,…) cross to the other hand; even numbers (2,4,6,…) return to the same hand; and <code class="k">0</code> indicates an empty beat.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>0</strong>: a beat when the hand is empty.</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong>: a direct pass to the other hand (no time for any other catch/throw in between).</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong>: a tiny self toss; the throwing hand cannot do anything else in that beat.</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong>: a cross to the other hand, leaving one beat for both hands to handle other balls.</li>
        <li><strong>4</strong>: a self toss high enough that the throwing hand can handle another ball while the other hand can handle two.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The numbers therefore encode relative height with respect to pace. One can throw a <code class="k">5</code> under the head quickly, or above three meters slowly; what matters is how many beats elapse while it’s in the air.</p>

      <p>Patterns repeat cyclically. We notate only one period, e.g., <code class="k">531</code> represents the repeating pattern <code class="k">531531531…</code></p>

      <h2>Not every sequence of numbers is a pattern!</h2>
      <p>Consider the sequence <code class="k">432</code>. First throw a <code class="k">4</code> with the right hand (a self), then a <code class="k">3</code> with the left (a cross). While both balls are in flight, the right hand tries to make a <code class="k">2</code> (a quick self). The right hand ends up with three balls arriving together: a <em>collision</em>. So <code class="k">432</code> is not executable.</p>

      <div class="theorem">
        <strong>Characterization theorem of siteswaps.</strong>
        <p>A finite sequence of non‑negative integers <span class="eq-inline">(s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ..., s<sub>n</sub>)</span> is executable (collision‑free) if and only if the residues</p>
        <div class="equation">(s<sub>i</sub> + i) mod n</div>
        <p>are pairwise distinct for <span class="eq-inline">i = 1, ..., n</span>.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Applying it to <code class="k">432</code> with <span class="eq-inline">n = 3</span> gives the residues <span class="eq-inline">2, 2, 2</span> (not distinct), hence invalid. Swapping the last two digits to get <code class="k">423</code> yields residues <span class="eq-inline">2, 1, 0</span> (all distinct), hence valid.</p>

      <div class="theorem">
        <strong>Theorem on the number of balls.</strong>
        <p>If <span class="eq-inline">(s<sub>1</sub>, ..., s<sub>n</sub>)</span> is a valid siteswap, then the number of balls equals the average height:</p>
        <div class="equation">
          <span class="frac">
            <span class="num">s<sub>1</sub> + s<sub>2</sub> + ... + s<sub>n</sub></span>
            <span class="den">n</span>
          </span>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>For example, for <span class="eq-inline">534</span> the average is <span class="eq-inline">(5 + 3 + 4) / 3 = 4</span> balls.</p>
      <h2>If you want to know more…</h2>
      <p>This page focused on vanilla siteswap. There are also notations for synchronous patterns, <em>multiplex</em> throws (one hand tossing multiple balls on the same beat), and <em>passing</em> between multiple jugglers.
